# Repository for RNAseq Tips + Tricks + Scripts 
**Authored:** Michael Grapin --- Moore Lab Research Technician At University of Nebraska Lincoln

# Outline: 





# Preprocessing RNAseq Reads 

## Quality Control (QC) 

## Contamination Removal 
* Applicable if you think you have a large number of forgein sequences that would impact you analysis. 

### rRNA Removal 
* Either in vitro biological methods (rRNA depletion or mRNA enrichment) or in silico computational methods. **Specific to your goals and methods used in your workflow** 

#### Software 
[SortMeRNA](https://github.com/sortmerna/sortmerna)

## Quantification 

### Genome Based Quantification

### Transcriptome Based Quantification 


# RNAseq Analyses

## Differential Expression 


## Tissue Expression Specificity 


## Whole Genome CoExpression Network Analysis (WGCNA)
